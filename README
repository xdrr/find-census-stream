# Find a working census stream

Not able to complete your census because each stream you hit is down or
returning an error? Automate the discovery of a working census stream
so you can do more important things.

## Description

This quick script automates the discovery of a ABS census stream with
a courtesy sleep so as to provide a midly faster and more intelligent
means of getting a stream that will let you complete your census.

NB this process should not induce any more load than manually visiting
the site over and over at a slow pace.

## Synopsis

Run the script...

```
./find-census-stream
```

...sit back and relax.
